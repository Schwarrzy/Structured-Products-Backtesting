# Structured-Products-Backtesting
 During my internship at i-Kapital, I had the opportunity to develop a script in python that would allow you to backtest any structure. The aim here was to simulate product launches in the past, in order to see a range of data including % early recall, % capital loss, and the impact of bonuses such as airbags or declining recall barriers.
